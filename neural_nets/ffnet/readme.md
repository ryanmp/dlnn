# installation

## prereqs

building ffnet requires a fortran compiler -> if you don't have one, one comes with gcc...

$ brew install gcc

## main install


$ easy_install ffnet

or

$ pip install ffnet 



## notes

Hm, it looks like there may be a naming inconsistency scipy derivative depending on which version of scipy you are using

But yet, some basic examples still work; so maybe this won't be a problem.
