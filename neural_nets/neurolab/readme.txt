requirements:
-------------



1. install the python library neurolab via:

easy_install neurolab OR pip install neurolab


2. the dataset needs to be in this dir, I think it's called contest_data1.out on my local machine


how to run:
-----------

I'll create an init.py or start.py which manage the steps eventually, but for now:

1. load.py takes in the raw data and spits out a pickle

2. run.py creates the nn and does the training
